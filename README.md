## Current tag-based release authorization

Pushing the matching version tag authorizes release in this repository. No manual
checksum variables, approval boolean, hosted-review approval, or `release`-branch
HEAD match is required. Branch candidates still validate their payloads; they do
not publish a GitHub Release or OCI version. Manual branch runs verify only.

Repository/tag/version and WIT identity checks, build/runtime tests, source and
build-evidence checks, nonempty LICENSE/NOTICE, exact embedded licensing bytes,
generated SHA256SUMS, independent candidates, and GitHub Release/OCI no-overwrite
checks remain required. The workflow uses the automatic GitHub token. Never move
or overwrite an existing version tag. Pages publication remains independent.

This policy supersedes historical approval-variable and pre-tag review/branch
requirements below, not source provenance or legal terms. It does not claim hosted
validation or authorize this editing session to commit, push, tag, or publish.
No source snapshots, legal texts, or historical evidence are refreshed.

> Prepared target: `plugin.layout` v0.2.1; not yet published.
> The documentation below is a frozen historical record, not current
> pending approval requirements. Its manual approval/checksum and pre-tag
> review/branch requirements are superseded above; content checks remain.

# plugin.layout

Standalone extraction of the GAMS stateless panel-layout WebAssembly component.
It exports `gams:layout/layout@1.0.0`; layout state remains in caller-owned
layout documents.

## Build and verify

```sh
nix develop --command make test
```

The test directly invokes the transpiled component and checks initialization,
resize, and invalid input handling. Build output is `dist/plugin.layout.wasm`.

The owner approved Apache-2.0 for GAMS-authored code. The repository-specific
third-party `NOTICE` and linked-code inventory were reviewed by the owner;
hosted Linux candidate evidence is still required before tagging. See `LICENSING.md`, `THIRD-PARTY-REVIEW.md`, and
`PUBLISHING.md` for the fail-closed candidate/release process.

## Local Project and documentation

```sh
nix develop --command make open  # build, then open this repository's gams.json
make serve-docs                 # http://localhost:8080; DOCS_PORT overrides
make validate-docs
make docs                       # portable site under build/site/
```

`make open` builds `dist/plugin.layout.wasm` and explicitly sets `GAMS_APP_CWD`
to this repository. The local Project loads that component and the pinned
released Files View to inspect Project files; it is not an API demo.
The layout UI Service uses the locally built layout component.
No sibling source checkout is required.

`make tools/gams.app` downloads the released macOS Apple Silicon Host only
when absent and retains its notices under `tools/gams-release-notices/`.
Existing downloads are not updated implicitly; macOS security checks remain
intact. The first download and Project launch require network access.
Pinned dependencies are declared in `gams.json`; Host caches live in ignored
`gams_modules/`. Native GUI behavior requires separate verification.

Documentation uses pinned justgook/wiki v1.4.0, with ignored engine/output
under `build/`. `build-docs` remains a build alias. GitHub Pages runs `make docs`
on every push to `release`, independently of component release tags.
Enable **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**. Existing component
build, runtime tests, candidate checks and matching-tag release rules are unchanged.
